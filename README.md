# Panda Diary

Panda Diary is a web application that works to support online sales of the client's products. Our application has two types of users. One is admin and another is client. These two users all share a same login interface. Our system has admin in-built data, so there is no need for admin to do registration. However, for the clients, they have to first register their personal info with our system and they then can log in. 

As a **client**, he or she can 
* can create a diary by choosing paper color, cover color, paper type and customizable text on the cover.
* make a purchase using PayPal and credit cards.
* select delivery options (standard and express, only Australia-wide)
* see the history of their purchases
* provide feedback

As a **admin**, he or she can
* edit all parameters of customization as well as their current availability
* create accounts for new admin as well as deactivate admin and client
* generate reports on the overall purchases on weekly and monthly basis
* moderate the feedback if necessary
